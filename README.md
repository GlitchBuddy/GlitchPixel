# The GlitchPixel font family

These are a couple of custom fonts I made in my spare time, originally for a video game project. They're fairly basic, but nonetheless they form the backbone of the GlitchBuddy brand.

Below you'll find a summary of the fonts:
* **GlitchPixel:** A large, lively font that can be used for titles, headings, or anywhere you need to make a big impression.
* **GlitchPixelMini:** A small font that's ideal for bodies of text.
* **GlitchSymbol:** A non-alphabet font that contains a play, pause and cross symbol (more may be added in the future)

These fonts were created using [PixelForge](https://www.pixel-forge.com).
These fonts are released under the SIL Open Font License, version 1.1 (the terms of which can be found in the "LICENSE" file).
